# About
I am interested in Computer Science and love to program whenever I have the time. I started programming in 2017 and continue to spend as much time possible working on my projects.

My favorite languages are Lua and C# .NET Core where I can make many different applications. I'm also an Anti-Cheat Developer and Researcher making Server-Side Anti-Cheats for the Roblox plateform after my previous work in packet based Minecraft Anti-Cheats.
